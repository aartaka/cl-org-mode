#+TITLE:cl-org-more: cl-org-mode improved twice

* What is it?

  CL-ORG-MORE is a three-component, layered solution for
  manipulation of Org-structured text:

  - CL-ORG-MORE-RAW ::
    provides tolerant parsing of Org-structured text into a semi-detailed AST
  - CL-ORG-MORE ::
    "dresses" the AST into a fairly rich object tree, and allows serialisation into text
  - CL-ORG-MORE-EXTENDED ::
    allows representation of DAGs in Org files, atop a CAS (content-addressed storage)

* Getting started
Clone the repository:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/aartaka/cl-org-more
#+end_src
Then, in your CL image, load =cl-org-more=
#+begin_src lisp
  ;; Put cl-org-more into somewhere ASDF can find it, or run
  ;; (asdf:load-asd #p"/path/to/cl-org-more/")
  (asdf:load-system :cl-org-more-extended)
#+end_src
And then you can test it
#+begin_src lisp
  (org:org-parse #p"/path/to/your/agenda.org")
#+end_src
And enjoy looking at your file parsed to a cool hierarchical object tree :)
