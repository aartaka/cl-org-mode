* What is it?

  CL-ORG-MODE-RAW provides tolerant parsing of Org-structured text
  into a semi-detailed AST.

* Properties

  * rougly follows the in-progress spec at:

    http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html

  * relative tolerance to improper input
  * a semi-acceptable precision/efficiency ratio, whatever that means
    - parses ~10kloc-long markup-heavy Org files in <10s
  * all greater elements supported:
    - dynamic blocks
    - greater blocks
    - drawers, including property drawers
  * non-greater elements supported:
    - paragraphs
    - affiliated keywords
  * based on PARSER-COMBINATORS, by Jakub Higersberger (thank you!)
  * has a built-in profiler

* Testing

  It would suffice to just do:

  #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (require :cl-org-more-tests)
  (asdf:test-system :cl-org-more)
  #+END_SRC

  ..although it would test the mid-layer parser as well.

  If you feel more adventurous, and would like to run your files
  through the test suite:

  #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (cl-org-more-raw-tests:test '(#p"/path/to/your/org-testcase-1.lisp"
                                #p"/path/to/your/org-testcase-2.lisp"))
  #+END_SRC

  It parses all 28 org files on my computer : -)
